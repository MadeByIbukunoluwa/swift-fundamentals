# Bridging in swift explanation using Dictionaries as an example

In Swift, the Dictionary type is bridged to Foundation's NSDictionary class, which means that Swift dictionaries can be seamlessly used with Objective-C code that expects an NSDictionary object.

When Swift was introduced, it aimed to provide interoperability with existing Objective-C code and frameworks. To achieve this, Swift's standard library includes a feature called "bridging" that allows certain Swift types to be automatically converted to their corresponding Objective-C types.

In the case of dictionaries, Swift's Dictionary type is bridged to Foundation's NSDictionary class, which is the equivalent dictionary class in Objective-C. This bridging allows you to pass Swift dictionaries to Objective-C APIs that expect an NSDictionary object as an argument, or receive an NSDictionary object from Objective-C code and use it as a Swift dictionary.

The bridging is performed automatically by the Swift compiler, so you don't need to explicitly convert between Swift dictionaries and NSDictionary objects in most cases. This seamless bridging makes it easier to work with Objective-C code and take advantage of existing frameworks and libraries while writing Swift code.

// Swift‚Äôs String type is a value type. If you create a new String value, that String value is copied when it‚Äôs passed to a function or method, or when it‚Äôs assigned to a constant or variable. In each case, a new copy of the existing String value is created, and the new copy is passed or assigned, not the original version.

//unicode
// Unicode is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems. It enables you to represent almost any character from any language in a standardized form, and to read and write those characters to and from an external source such as a text file or web page.
//Behind the scenes, Swift‚Äôs native String type is built from Unicode scalar values. A Unicode scalar value is a unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier, such as U+0061 for LATIN SMALL LETTER A ("a"), or U+1F425 for FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK ("üê•").

// Every instance of Swift‚Äôs Character type represents a single extended grapheme cluster. An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character.

// Here‚Äôs an example. The letter √© can be represented as the single Unicode scalar √© (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE, or U+00E9). However, the same letter can also be represented as a pair of scalars ‚Äî a standard letter e (LATIN SMALL LETTER E, or U+0065), followed by the COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar (U+0301). The COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar is graphically applied to the scalar that precedes it, turning an e into an √© when it‚Äôs rendered by a Unicode-aware text-rendering system.

// In both cases, the letter √© is represented as a single Swift Character value that represents an extended grapheme cluster. In the first case, the cluster contains a single scalar; in the second case, it‚Äôs a cluster of two scalars:



let eAcute :Character = "\u{E9}"
let combinedEAcute:Character = "\u{65}\u{301}"

print(eAcute,combinedEAcute)

// Extended grapheme clusters are a flexible way to represent many complex single script achracters as a single Chracter value 
// For example, Hangul syllables from the Korean alphabet can be represented as either a precomposed or decomposed sequence. Both of these representations qualify as a single Character value in Swift:

let precomposed : Character = "\u{D55C}"

let decomposed : Character = "\u{1112}\u{1161}\u{11AB}"

print(precomposed,decomposed)

// Extended grapheme clusters enable scalars for enclosing marks (such as COMBINING ENCLOSING CIRCLE, or U+20DD) to enclose other Unicode scalars as part of a single Character value:

let enclosedEAcute:Character = "\u{E9}\u{20DD}"

//Unicode scalara for regional indicator symbols can be combiend in pairs to amke a single character value 

let regionalIndicatorForUS:Character = "\u{1F1FA}\u{F1F8}"

//An arbitrary Unicode scalar value, written as \u{n}, where n is a 1‚Äì8 digit hexadecimal number

// Swift‚Äôs String type is a value type. If you create a new String value, that String value is copied when it‚Äôs passed to a function or method, or when it‚Äôs assigned to a constant or variable. In each case, a new copy of the existing String value is created, and the new copy is passed or assigned, not the original version.

//unicode
// Unicode is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems. It enables you to represent almost any character from any language in a standardized form, and to read and write those characters to and from an external source such as a text file or web page.
//Behind the scenes, Swift‚Äôs native String type is built from Unicode scalar values. A Unicode scalar value is a unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier, such as U+0061 for LATIN SMALL LETTER A ("a"), or U+1F425 for FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK ("üê•").

// Every instance of Swift‚Äôs Character type represents a single extended grapheme cluster. An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character.

// Here‚Äôs an example. The letter √© can be represented as the single Unicode scalar √© (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE, or U+00E9). However, the same letter can also be represented as a pair of scalars ‚Äî a standard letter e (LATIN SMALL LETTER E, or U+0065), followed by the COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar (U+0301). The COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT scalar is graphically applied to the scalar that precedes it, turning an e into an √© when it‚Äôs rendered by a Unicode-aware text-rendering system.

// In both cases, the letter √© is represented as a single Swift Character value that represents an extended grapheme cluster. In the first case, the cluster contains a single scalar; in the second case, it‚Äôs a cluster of two scalars:



let eAcute :Character = "\u{E9}"
let combinedEAcute:Character = "\u{65}\u{301}"

print(eAcute,combinedEAcute)

// Extended grapheme clusters are a flexible way to represent many complex single script achracters as a single Chracter value 
// For example, Hangul syllables from the Korean alphabet can be represented as either a precomposed or decomposed sequence. Both of these representations qualify as a single Character value in Swift:

let precomposed : Character = "\u{D55C}"

let decomposed : Character = "\u{1112}\u{1161}\u{11AB}"

print(precomposed,decomposed)

// Extended grapheme clusters enable scalars for enclosing marks (such as COMBINING ENCLOSING CIRCLE, or U+20DD) to enclose other Unicode scalars as part of a single Character value:

let enclosedEAcute:Character = "\u{E9}\u{20DD}"

//Unicode scalara for regional indicator symbols can be combiend in pairs to amke a single character value 

let regionalIndicatorForUS = "\u{1F1FA}\u{F1F8}"

print(regionalIndicatorForUS)

// Counting Charcters 
let unusualMenagerie = "Koala üê®, Snail üêå, Penguin üêß, Dromedary üê™"

print("unusualMenagerie has \(unusualMenagerie.count) characters")

// Note that Swift‚Äôs use of extended grapheme clusters for Character values means that string concatenation and modification may not always affect a string‚Äôs character count.

// For example, if you initialize a new string with the four-character word cafe, and then append a COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301) to the end of the string, the resulting string will still have a character count of 4, with a fourth character of eÃÅ, not e:


var word = "cafe"

print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")

word += "\u{301}"

print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")

//Accessing and modifying a string 


//different characters can require different amounts of memory to store, so in order to determine which Character is at a particular position, you must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of that String. For this reason, Swift strings can‚Äôt be indexed by integer values.

// each srtng value has an associated index type , String.Index which corresponds to the position of each string 

//You access the indices before and after a given index using the index(before:) and index(after:) methods of String. To access an index farther away from the given index, you can use the index(_:offsetBy:) method instead of calling one of these methods multiple times.

let greeting = "Guten Tag! "

print(greeting[greeting.startIndex])

print(greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)])

print(greeting[greeting.index(after: greeting.startIndex)])

let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 7)

print(greeting[index])


// attemting to access an index outside of a strings range or a character outside of a string's rnage will trigger a runtime error 

// greeting[greeting.endIndex]

// greeting.index(after:greeting.endIndex)


for index in greeting.indices {
    print("\(greeting[index])", terminator: "")
}

//You can use the startIndex and endIndex properties and the index(before:), index(after:), and index(_:offsetBy:) methods on any type that conforms to the Collection protocol. This includes String, as shown here, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set.


//inserting and removing 

var welcome1 = "hello"

welcome1.insert("!",at:welcome1.endIndex)


welcome1.insert(contentsOf: " there", at: welcome1.index(before:welcome1.endIndex))

print(welcome1)

// to remove a specified character from a string at a specified index, use the remove(at:) method, and to remove a substring at a specified range, use the remove Subrange(_:) method 

welcome1.remove(at: welcome1.index(before:welcome1.endIndex))

let range: Range<String.Index> = welcome1.index(welcome1.startIndex, offsetBy: 6)..<welcome1.endIndex

welcome1.removeSubrange(range)

print(welcome1)
// welcome1.removeSubrange(range)

// welcome should now equal "hello" 

// You can use the insert(_:at:), insert(contentsOf:at:), remove(at:), and removeSubrange(_:) methods on any type that conforms to the RangeReplaceableCollection protocol. This includes String, as shown here, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set.


//Substring
//When you get a substring from a string ‚Äî for example, using a subscript or a method like prefix(_:) ‚Äî the result is an instance of Substring, not another string.

//However, unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you‚Äôre ready to store the result for a longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of String. 


let greeting = "Hello, world"

let index = greeting.firstIndex(of: ",") ?? greeting.endIndex

let beginning = greeting[..<index]


let newStirng = String(beginning)

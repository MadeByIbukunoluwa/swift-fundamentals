// These kinds of optionals are defined as implicitly unwrapped optionals. You write an implicitly unwrapped optional by placing an exclamation point (String!) rather than a question mark (String?) after the type that you want to make optional. Rather than placing an exclamation point after the optional‚Äôs name when you use it, you place an exclamation point after the optional‚Äôs type when you declare it.
